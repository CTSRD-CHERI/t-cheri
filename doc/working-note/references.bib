  abstract = { CHERI-MIPS is an instruction set architecture that
      provides hardware support for secure encapsulation
                  and fine-grained memory protection. The guarantees
                  it intends to offer are described in high-level
                  prose, which makes it difficult to understand what
                  they precisely are, whether they are true, and
                  whether they indeed provide memory protection. We
                  describe ongoing work on proposing formal
                  definitions of these guarantees and proving that
                  they are true.}

  abstract = {Architecture specifications notionally define the fundamental interface between hardware and software: the envelope of allowed behaviour for processor implementations, and the basic assumptions for software development and verification.  But in practice, they are typically prose and pseudocode documents, not rigorous or executable artifacts, leaving software and verification on shaky ground.

In this paper, we present rigorous semantic models for the sequential behaviour of large parts of the mainstream ARMv8-A, RISC-V, and MIPS architectures, and the research CHERI-MIPS architecture, that are complete enough to boot operating systems, variously Linux, FreeBSD, or seL4.  Our ARMv8-A models are automatically translated from authoritative ARM-internal definitions, and (in one variant) tested against the ARM Architecture Validation Suite.

We do this using a custom language for ISA semantics, Sail, with a lightweight dependent type system, that supports automatic generation of emulator code in C and OCaml, and automatic generation of proof-assistant definitions for Isabelle, HOL4, and (currently only for MIPS) Coq.  We use the former for validation, and to assess specification coverage.  To demonstrate the usability of the latter, we prove (in Isabelle) correctness of a purely functional characterisation of ARMv8-A address translation.  We moreover integrate the RISC-V model into the RMEM tool for (user-mode) relaxed-memory concurrency exploration.  We prove (on paper) the soundness of the core Sail type system.

We thereby take a big step towards making the architectural abstraction actually well-defined, establishing foundations for verification and reasoning.
